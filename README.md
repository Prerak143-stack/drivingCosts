# drivingCosts
This is the Python program. It would ask for total daily drive in kilometres, how much the gas cost for per litre, what is the car's kilometres per litre rating. Using this data program would calculate what is the best possible speed that you can drive your car at, how much is it going to cost you if you drive over that speed and how many minutes you can save per day if you go over that speed.
